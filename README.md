# HealthSecureOps
0)For this project, we chose Cybersecurity as our primary focus for further development due to the importance that it holds in our society. We are designing software for the healthcare industry because it needs a high security software, especially since it is a field that makes such a huge impact in people's everyday lives. Due to the volatile nature of healthcare, sensitive information and documents are stored in healthcare databases, making them prime targets for cybersecurity attacks and raids. This project aims to design a security software that addresses these vulnerabilities, ensuring that critical data remains protected from cyber threats.

2)For this prototype, it was designed for an exceptional user experience created through the elemental designs in Figma. On a web browser view, the user starts off on the welcome page of the cyberware, "HealthSecureOps." From there, they are able to either sign in or click on the "SignUp" link to be redirected to the signup page. After the initial login, it directs them to the homepage with all the tabs/features shown. The user is able to click on the different tabs and it's redirected to its main page.
